I was a complete beginner in programming at the start of the 2020, I barely understood html, yet at the end of the year I managed find myself a job as a developer and also passed the Solution Architect Associate Exam recently.

So I'd like to share about my experience on how I studied for this exam. Also if you're interested about how I changed my career from biology/medicine related background and get myself into tech, please leave a comment below.

My study for this Exam can be broken into three part:
- Theory & Hands-on Play around, chilling study period (1 month)
- Intensive Study Period (half month)

### Chilling Study Period

During this period, I also had another commitment, so I only managed to study for the concept about 1-2 hour per day. 

I first purchased a course on Udemy (any course will do, none of them I would say it's **"THE COURSE"** to buy). Here are two thing I mainly do at the beginning

1. Research any topic that I am not familiar with (eg: what does on-premise means ? what is serverless ? what is DNS ? etc.)
  
Trust me, there will be millions things you will google if you do curious about what **cloud** is really about.

1. Make use of some services that you have some ideas on how to use them in a interesting way (eg: make use of AWS Lambda & API Gateway,S3, EC2. etc.)

Below are some example using the service included in free tire:

- I made `soduku solver` with the algorithm hosted in `AWS Labmda`
- I built a file uploading frontend application using S3-presigned Url
- I Host a minecraft server on EC2

etc..

Doing so not only can you practice your technical skill on whatever stack you chose, you can also gain more general knowledge about full-stack and cloud.
  

### Intense Study Period

During this period, I did two thing

- Review and Summarise all the concepts related with scope of the certificate exam on **Notion**.
- I purchased some Practice Exam, I refine my **Study note** as I went through the practice exams.

This is about half of a month, and I studied about 5-6 hours per day. result of the exam is now scaled base on difficulties. But getting an average between 75-85% on practice exam will be sufficient to pass the exam.

Practice exam is important (search SAA exam-dump on google you find a tone). I recommend try the online exam-engine, because it resembles the actual exam style, it's better to get use to conducting exam on computer. Also some question did appear on the actual exam, so make sure you do enough practice.

for your reference: I did 11 practice exam (800+ questions), and with average around 78%

### Summary and Experience

I had no fundamental knowledge about IT/CS/Cloud at all

- Study time: 1 month + 0.5 month (~120h)
- Study Resources: Udemy Course, Youtube (FreeCodeCamp), AWS Documentation
- My Result: 793 / 1000
- Outcome: Result(Pass/Fail) shows on screen right after exam. Detail report will be emailed shortly (takes hours or days)
- Place for exam: Although you can do your exam at home, reviews online are unamously bad, so I went to testing center
- Related Fee (AUD): 
  - Udemy course ($ 15)
  - Practice Exam ($ 25)
  - AWS Service Bills($ 40), Avoidable if you play more attention on all service that you played around with and make sure you terminated them all right after you used them
  - Exam ($ 220)

### Study Note

Lastly I'd like to share my study notes on Notion, [Here is the link](https://www.notion.so/AWS-Solution-Architect-Associate-2020-c224935cfb98410b822530bce8716971)
